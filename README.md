## Introduction

Milestone Project 4: Full-Stack Frameworks with Django - Code Institute

The Hawthorn Wine Co. is a Full-Stack webpage for a Wine Company opening in early 2021.
The main purpose is to offer an online store selling imported wines.
The site will also function to build the brand's identity and to incorporate the business owners desired colour schemes, logos, fonts etc. as well as links to their social media.
My main purpose when creating the webpage was to ensure that the site provided a pleasant and uncomplicated user experience allowing the user to access the appropriate information and make a purchase hassle free.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used throughout the site are black, white and Seashell Peach.
        -   The site's colour scheme and styling was based on the Owner's request that the site have an independent feel to reflect the business type. 
    -   #### Typography
            I picked an artistic style font giving a hand-drawn feel for the Main-Logo.
        -   Clean, modern type for heading and text. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The main image for the site is a large,background hero image with an "OPEN" sign.  As this is a brand new business I thought this was an appropriate choice
        -   The Company Name and also their "Hawthorn Tree" SVG logo also features thorughout the site. 

*   ### Wireframes
    -   I drew the Wireframes for this project as I find drawing them allows for more detailed notes as well as being a more efficient  use of time.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes.

-   Submit, Edit and Delete operations to manage book recommendations.

-   About page with link to article which inspired the project plus clear instructions on how to proceed.

### Future Features 

 # Login System
- A User Login System would open up the possibility of users being able to login and edit their uploads securely.

 # Chart System
- When enough users have submitted books to the site I would like to implement a chart system recording the most popular books. This     would enhance the user experience and make the site more useful.

 # Upload Image with Book Submissions
- Providing the possibility to upload an image/link to the book cover would make the site more visually appealing.

## Deployment

I used GitHub for my version control and Heroku to host the live version of my project. 


To deploy my website to Heroku, I used the following steps:

1. Created the app in Heroku.
2. Run the `snap install --classic heroku` command in the terminal window to instal heroku in my local workspace.
3. Ran the `heroku login -i` command in the terminal window and entered my credentials to login to Heroku.
4. Added and committed the files to Git.
5. Linked the Heroku app as the remote master branch.
6. Created a requirements.txt file.
7. Created a Procfile
8. Ran the `git push heroku master` command in the terminal window to push the app to Heroku.
9. Ran the `heroku ps:scale web=1` command in the terminal window to run the app in Heroku.
10. Entered the following Config Var in Heroku:

    ```MONGO_URI : <link to MongoDB>```


The app was successfully deployed to Heroku at this stage.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

#### Note:
- For Secret Key contact me @ jonmurrii@gmail.com

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
